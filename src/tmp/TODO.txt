Hi Ryan-  Here are my notes from phone chat on 13 Oct. It seemed like you were taking your own notes, so this is probably old news.  Cheers, Chris




DONE:
Align text for col names and units (Used Monospace 9 for this	)
Program should quit when window closes
Color for active plot (blue/red?).
Distance tool: x-hair w/ x,y coordinates at ends of line
Toggling from Normal to Draw line seems to lose cursor-data tracking. 
Add row below current X/Y to show 'last click'
Right click: show x/y and draw crosshair on canvas at click position
left click: show x/y location on active graph at closest point to click; report x, y, row as "last click" in header

Questions:

Line and Normal mode are essentially the same- if you click and don't drag, it could create a point annotation- would you like to combine them?
