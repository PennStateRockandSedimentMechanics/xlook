####### BUILDING ON THE PC

Downloaded MinGW- latest (this was mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe)
Installed it
Opened the mingw shell
typed:
mingw-get upgrade

To bring all the tools up to date.

vim ~/.profile

Add this line:

PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files/Git/bin:/c/MinGW/msys/gtk/bin

Log out of shell, relaunch a new MinGw shell

Downloaded gtk+/2.24 from:

http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24

Extract that to C:\MinGw\msys\gtk

Log out of shell, relaunch a new MinGw shell

pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0

gtk-demo

(should show a GTK Demo window)

# You have to setup a github account, and have Chris or I add you to the Users so you can see the repo.
# You have to setup your shared keys within the git repo

# Pull down the code....
git clone git@github.com:PennStateRockandSedimentMechanics/xlook.git

# Change into the "new" directory
cd xlook/gtk

# Copy the pkg.m4 script to the aclocal location...
cp pkg.m4 `aclocal --print-ac-dir`

# You should be able to just:
make

############### On the Macintosh
# You have to setup a github account, and have Chris or I add you to the Users so you can see the repo.
# You have to setup your shared keys within the git repo

# Pull down the code....
git clone git@github.com:PennStateRockandSedimentMechanics/xlook.git

# Install GTK from the .pkg at 
xlook/gtk/GTK_2...

# (If this isn't in your path, make sure it is...)
export PATH=$PATH:/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Resources/bin

# If you get this issue:
#./configure: line 3685: syntax error near unexpected token `GTK,'
#./configure: line 3685: `PKG_CHECK_MODULES(GTK, gtk+-2.0)'

# Do this:
sudo cp pkg.m4 `aclocal --print-ac-dir`

You should be able to build cleanly with just make at this point.


/*---- My notes below */


(assuming you used the default git install directory)
autoscan (creates configure.scan, or rescans configure.ac)

Create your sources. (Be sure to have a simple “Makefile” to help Autoconf autodetect things better.)
Run “autoscan” to generate “configure.scan”.
Rename “configure.scan” to “configure.ac”.
Run “autoheader” to generate “config.h.in”.
Make your source portable by looking at “config.h.in”. (We previously did this at a later step by reading “config.h”, but we can do it in this step by referring to “config.h.in” instead.)
Create “Makefile.am”.
Run “automake”.
Fix errors and run “automake” again.
Run “aclocal”.
Run “autoconf”.
Configure, make, and run!

(Errors on pkg-config)

(Rerun autoscan to get the latest configure.ac up to snuff)
add configure test for GTK method (not sure which one)

export LDFLAGS='-L/c/MinGW/msys/gtk/lib'

aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal (location of .m4 scripts for PKG_CHECK_MODULES
